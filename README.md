# Employee-Rtention

   - **Description:** This project focuses on analyzing employee data to gain insights into various key performance indicators (KPIs) related to attrition, age distribution, monthly income distribution, and more. The analysis is performed using SQL for data querying and Excel for data visualization.

**2. Introduction:**
   - **Context:** In the context of this project, we are examining employee data to better understand the workforce within an organization.
   - **Objectives:** The main objectives of this project are to assess employee attrition rates, explore the age distribution of employees, and visualize the distribution of monthly incomes to gain insights into salary demographics.

**3. Data Description:**
   - **Dataset:** The dataset used for this analysis contains employee-related information, including attributes such as age, monthly income, attrition status, and more. The dataset is stored in SQL and Excel formats.

**4. Data Analysis with SQL:**
   - **SQL Queries:** SQL queries were employed to perform various data analysis tasks, including calculating attrition rates, filtering and aggregating data, and extracting relevant information from the dataset. Sample SQL queries may include:
     - Calculating attrition rates.
     - Aggregating data by department or job role.
     - Extracting data related to employee demographics.

**5. Data Visualization in Excel:**
   - **Excel Visualizations:** Excel was utilized for visualizing the analyzed data. Various charts and graphs were created to represent key findings and KPIs, including:
     - Histograms to visualize age distribution.
     - Bar charts to depict attrition rates.
     - Bar charts or histograms to illustrate monthly income distribution.
     - Additional charts to represent other KPIs, such as job satisfaction levels and work-life balance.

**6. Tools and Technologies:**
   - **SQL:** Structured Query Language (SQL) was used for data querying and manipulation.
   - **Excel:** Microsoft Excel was employed for data visualization and creating charts and graphs.

**7. Methodology:**
   - **Data Preprocessing:** The initial dataset may have undergone preprocessing steps, such as data cleaning or handling missing values.
   - **SQL Analysis:** SQL queries were written and executed to perform data analysis tasks, including calculating KPIs.
   - **Excel Visualization:** Excel was used to create visual representations of the data, allowing for easy interpretation and communication of insights.

**8. Results and Insights:**
   - **Attrition Rates:** The analysis revealed attrition rates and factors contributing to attrition.
   - **Age Distribution:** Visualizations showcased the age demographics of the workforce.
   - **Monthly Income Distribution:** Histograms or charts depicted the salary distribution among employees.
   - **Other KPIs:** Insights into additional KPIs, such as job satisfaction levels, may also be mentioned here.

**9. Future Work:**
   - Future iterations of this project could include predictive modeling to anticipate attrition or more detailed segmentation of employee data for targeted HR strategies.

**10. How to Run the Code:**
   - Provide instructions on how to replicate the analysis using the SQL queries and Excel visualizations.
   - Include information on how to access the dataset, if applicable.
